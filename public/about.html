<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Aspiring web designer who purchased an online course a few months ago when I was confused about what I wanted to do for a living.</p>

<p>Since then, I've continued on with my driving instructing day job thinking it was a waste of time purchasing this course, despite the fact it was on sale for like Â£12 but I've been v poor so felt dumb for buying it.</p>

<p>I have however gotten back into the idea of completing this course as we're planning a wedding and one of the tasks for that is to sort a Wedding webiste for RSVPs and potentially photo uploads depending on how far we get with the learning process!</p>
