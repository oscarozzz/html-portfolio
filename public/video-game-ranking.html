<h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>
<p>Fantastic game, sad to have finished it, our single playthrough lasted over 300 hours!</p>
<h3>Mario Party Superstars</h3>
<p>Really fun party game to play with friends, some BS always happens but it's great!</p>
<h3>Mario Kart 8</h3>
<p>Hours of fun, good value for money despite buying it on both the Wii U and the Switch</p>
